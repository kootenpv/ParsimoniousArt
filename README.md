# Parsimonious Art

*__Parsimonious__ - unwilling to spend money or use resources; stingy or frugal.*

An exercise in mathematically minimalistic, yet aesthetically
pleasing and recognisable art. Given a grid of fixed size,
it is our job to minimise the area of our art and the length
of lines used while conveying the same message as our realistic
counterparts. For instance, take the parsimonious drawing of a
house to the left of this paragraph.

But parsimonious art deserves an equally parsimonious community
of people that are willing to vote on how recognisable something
is. What we hope to achieve in the future is to:

* Finalise a *parsimoniousness* metric.
* Have a preferrably realtime website/repository which indexes
  scores associated with each parsimonious image. (A cheap solution
  would be a gallery on imgur: we just calculate ``upvotes/total_votes``).
* Have an equally parsimonious renderer and an easy-to-edit format
  to store our image vectors with. Preferrably some sort of JSON
  to SVG script.
